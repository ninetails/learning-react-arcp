# Learning Advanced React Component Patterns

Course by [egghead](https://egghead.io/) and Kent C. Dodds.

Course URL: [Advanced React Component Patterns](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-react-component-patterns)

-----

## Notes

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* I was mistaken about lesson order, so lessons 01 and 02 are 02 and 03 respectively
* Lesson 09 was skipped because it was about behavior on testing high order components

## Please read

This course was made when it was free.

I didn't had the original assets because it's only accessible with a **Pro** subscription on *egghead*, so I bootstrapped using *create-react-app* and adapted a Switch element styling found on Codepen.

There were also some modifications that I've made like arranging components on folders (not all of them) and some more steps for high order component.

And I wish to thank [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds) for that awesome course.

*And if him or egghead's staff wants to make this repository private because the content, please send a PM/open issue. I made this to have as reference*
